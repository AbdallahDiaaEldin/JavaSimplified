# Java, Simplified

A small project to help programming enthusiasts to learn Java (and programming, in general) in an informal, fun way. The project aims to be interesting and informative at the same time, allowing young readers to remain engaged.

Initially the project was created to assist students in a workshop I was doing. It was also a means to practice my basic HTML and CSS skills. However, I plan to add to this site and hopefully this will be useful to anyone & everyone.

## Timeline

Jul 29 - Started project and added all the basic topics.

Sept 5 - Workshop content done, started working on more topics.

## Things to Work On

* [ ] Add pictures to existing content so it is easier to understand the content in question.
