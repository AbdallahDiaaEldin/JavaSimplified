# Java, Simplified

A small project to help programming enthusiasts to learn Java (and programming, in general) in an informal, fun way. The project aims to be interesting and informative at the same time, allowing young readers to remain engaged.

Initially the project was created to assist students in a workshop I was doing. However, I plan to add to this and hopefully this will be useful to anyone and everyone.

## Timeline

* Jul 29 - Started project and added all the basic topics.

* Sept 5 - Workshop content done, started working on more topics.

## Features

*
* [] Add pictures to existing content so it is easier to understand the content in question.
* [] Start working on the 'Loops' section.
