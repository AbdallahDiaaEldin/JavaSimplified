                    This page will be a very loose and informal introduction to the Java programming language. It will serve as a good stepping stone into coding in general. Expect the guide to be informative in nature but not extremely technical.

                    The reason I chose Java (over Python or any other language) for the workshop is due to the "strictness" of the language. It teaches good habits whilst also being a good first language. However, the workshop is intended to be language agnostic - meaning that the content learnt will be applicable across any language of your choice!

                    Getting started is quite simple actually. You just need to install Eclipse of Java Developers. Its a simple software which allows you to write your code and run it, all in one place.
                </p>
                
                <p>An extra, supplementary note: running Java code without Eclipse can be a bit hard, since you have to manually run it using multiple commands.</p>

                <article>
                <p>Probably the first thing anyone does when learning any language is write a program that says "Hello World!."</p>
                
                <p>Its actually a good starting point simply because you are actually 'creating' something smart! Almost like a robot saying its first sentence, greeting the world!</p>
                
                <p>To make Eclipse say "Hello World!" we actually need just 1 statement! Copy and paste this into the editor and run it. Then look at the console!</p>
                
                <code>System.out.println("Hello World!");</code>

                <p>A program is not as smart as you might think (for better or for worse!). You need to specify what information you are feeding into the program.</p>
                
                <p>The data you can write in the program is known as 'variables'. Just like in math, we have 'x' and 'y' as variables, we have variables in programming.</p>

                <p>Variables can be any combination of letters and numbers, except a few rules that exist to reduce confusion. Some examples are below:</p>
                <code>helloWorld
                <br>abc
                <br>x
                <br>y1
                </code>

                <p>These variables have types as well! You specify those for the program to understand. A list of variables which you will be using is given below:</p>

                <code>
                    <ul>
                    <li>int - Integers</li>
                    <li>double - Decimal Numbers</li>
                    <li>boolean - true and false</li>
                    <li>String - Combination of letters, words, numbers - practically any written sentence!</li>
                    <li>char - Single letters</li>
                    </ul>
                </code>
                </article>
                
            </section>
            
            <section class="main-section" id="if-else_statements">

                <p>It might be a very new concept to you, but it is as simple as it sounds!</p>
                
                <p>Imagine I told you to do something, but there is a condition to it. What I mean is, what if I told you to carry out this instruction: "If today is Friday, do not go to school." The computer can also understand this, if you can tell it in a certain way! For example:</p>
                
                <code>
                    if (today == Friday) {
                    <br>
                    <br>goToSchool = false;
                    <br>
                    <br>}
                </code>
                
                <p>Now lets add the other case - what if it isn't Friday? We can write this as: "but if it is not Friday, do go to school." We just add the code below to the previous one.</p>
                <code>
                    else {
                    <br>
                    <br>goToSchool = false;
                    <br>
                    <br>}
                </code>
                </article>
                
            </section>
